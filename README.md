# 7 GUIs utilizing Elysia with Bun runtime

The tasks were selected by the following criteria. 

The task set should be as small as possible yet reflect as many typical (or fundamental or representative) challenges in GUI programming as possible. 

Each task should be as simple and self-contained as possible yet not too artificial. 

Preferably, a task should be based on existing examples as that gives the task more justification to be useful and there already will be at least one reference implementation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this template, simply paste this command into your terminal:
```bash
bun create elysia ./elysia-example
```

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
